# Cattle-Health-Prediction-using-Hybrid-Model
PURPOSED METHOD 1
The CNN and LSTM networks are used to process and analyze the data collected by the IoT sensors, allowing for accurate and reliable predictions of cow health.
The results showed that the framework achieved high accuracy in predicting
the health status of the cows, with an overall accuracy of 94%.
The framework was also able to detect anomalies and alert the farmers in
real-time, allowing for timely intervention to prevent potential health problems.

Implementation of Predicting Cow Health
Input pre-processed data: Collect data from various sensors 
attached to the cows, pre-process the data by extracting 
relevant features, and convert it into a suitable format for 
the CNN-LSTM model.

Step 1: Implement the CNN: In this phase, the first thing 
done is to set up a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
architecture. With the help of CNN, features will be pulled 
out of the data that has already been given. The core of the 
architecture will be several convolutional layers with 
different-sized filters, followed by layers that are only for 
pooling the data.
Convolutional layer: In the convolutional layer, the CNN 
algorithm makes decisions about what to do next. It does 
this by putting a number of filters on the image it's given 
so it can figure out how healthy the cow is. For the 
convolutional layer, use the following formula:
Output size = (Input size - Filter size + 2 * Padding) / 
Stride + 1
For the purposes of this discussion, we will call the size of 
the input image the "input size," the size of the 
convolutional filter the "filter size," the number of pixels 
added to the edges of the input image the "padding" 
amount, the step size of the filter the "stride" amount, and 
the size of the output image the "step size of the feature 
map."
Latent pooling: The dimension reduction work that is done 
on the feature maps that were made by the convolutional 
layer is done by the pooling layer. Because of this, 
overfitting is less likely to happen, and the model works 
better overall. An equation can be used to describe the 
pooling layer:
Output size = (Input size - Pool size) / Stride + 1
The input is the size of the feature map, the intermediate 
step is the size of the pooling filter, the stride is the number 
of pixels that the filter moves by in each step, and the final 
step is the size of the pooled feature map.
A flattening layer takes the two-dimensional feature maps 
made by the convolutional and pooling layers and makes 
them ready for the fully connected layers.
The input of the fully connected layer, which is the 
flattened vector, is given a set of weights so that the output, 
which is the result of this process, can be made. To make a 
layer that is fully connected, use the following formula:
Output size = Input size * Weight + Bias
In this case, "weight" means the learned set of weights, 
"bias" means the "bias term," and "input size" means the 
size of the input vector after it has been "flattened."
The last layer of the convolutional neural network (CNN) 
method is called the softmax layer, and it is in charge of 
making a probability distribution over the classes. The 
softmax function is used on the output of the fully 
connected layer to make this happen.

# Define the CNN architecture
Model = keras.Sequential([
layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation= ‘rule’, 
input_shape=(224, 224,3)),
layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
layers.Flatten(),
layers.Dense(64, activation=’relu’)
layers.Dense(1, activation=’sigmodi’)
])
# Compile the CNN
model.compile(optimizer=’adam’,
loss=’binary_crossentropy’,
metrics=[‘accuracy’])
#Train the CNN
Model.fit(train_images, train_lables, epochs=10,
Validation_data=(val_images, val_lables))
#Evaluate the CNN
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, 
test_lables, verbose=2)
print(‘\nTest accuracy:’, test_acc)
# Predictions cow health
precictions = model.predict(new_images)

Once the CNN algorithm is trained, it can be used to 
predict the cow's health status by inputting a new image 
into the network and observing the predicted probability 
distribution over the different health classes.
the CNN algorithm is a powerful tool for predicting cow 
health based on image data. With the right training data 
and parameters, it can accurately classify images of cows 
into different health categories and provide valuable 
insights to farmers and animal health experts.


Step 1: Implement the LSTM:In this case, "weight" 
means the set of weights that were learned, "bias" means 
the "bias term," and "input size" means the size of the input 
vector after it has been "flattened."
The last layer of the convolutional neural network (CNN) 
method is called the softmax layer, and its job is to make a 
probability distribution over the classes. This is done by 
using the softmax function on the output of the fully 
connected layer.
h_t = f_t * h_t-1 + i_t * g_t
c_t = c_t-1 * f_t + i_t * g_t
o_t = sigma(W_o * [h_t, x_t] + b_o)
y_t = sigma(W_y * h_t + b_y)
Where:
h_t is the hidden state at time step t
x_t is the input feature vector at time step t
c_t is the cell state at time step t
i_t is the input gate at time step t
f_t is the forget gate at time step t
g_t is the candidate state at time step t
o_t is the output gate at time step t
y_t is the predicted cow health label at time step t
sigma is the activation function (such as sigmoid or tanh)
W_o, b_o, W_y, and b_y are weight matrices and biases 
used in the model.
The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is a type of 
recurrent neural network (RNN) that can handle long-term 
dependencies in sequential input.
 The application has a big positive effect on time-series prediction applications, like 
figuring out how healthy a cow is by looking at sensor data 
from the animal over time.
To use the LSTM model to predict how healthy the cows are, the data must be preprocessed by first extracting features that contain useful information and then separating the data into sets that will be used to train and test the model. After that, the number of hidden units and layers in the LSTM model, as well as the input and output dimensions, can be set.
 During the training process, we can use the training data and methods like backpropagation through time (BPTT) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to find the best model parameters (SGD). The algorithm is taught to look for patterns in the data that show how healthy the cow is. It is then used to make decisions. 
After the model has been trained, it can be tested with a validation dataset, and any changes that are needed to reach the level of accuracy that was set can be made. 
Lastly, the trained model can be used to make predictions based on new, unobserved data. This means that sensor readings can be used to learn about the health of cows in almost real time. This is possible because the model can learn from the data it has already seen. When used with historical sensor data, the LSTM model can make accurate predictions about how cows are feeling from a physiological point of view. We can use the above-mentioned formula to build a model, which we can then train in order to make accurate predictions about the health of cows and give farmers and experts in animal health useful information.

Step 2: After the LSTM layer, dense layers can be added to the model to make it more general and prevent it from becoming too specific. For the most accurate prediction, the output of the LSTM layer can be sent to one or more Dense layers.
Define the LSTM model architecture: The LSTM model can be set up with several layers of LSTMs so that it can process sequences of inputs and pull out the most important properties. The decision about how many LSTM layers to use may depend on how complicated the data is and how precise the results need to be.
Add Dropout layers: To reduce the risk of overfitting in the model, Dropout layers can be added between the LSTM layers. Dropout layers randomly drop out a fraction of the nodes during training, which helps in preventing the model from memorizing the training data.
Add Dense layers: Dense layers can be added to the LSTM model to perform the final classification task. The output of the last LSTM layer can be passed through one or more Dense layers to predict the health status of the cow.


With the help of the piece of code shown below, you can 
make a Dropout and Dense layer LSTM model:
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dropout, 
Dense
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim), 
return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout (0.2))
model.add( LSTM(64, return_sequence=True))
model.add( Dropout(0.2))
model.add( LSTM (32))
model.add( Dense (1, activation= ‘sigmodi’))
model.compile(loss=’binary_crosssentropy’, 
optimizer=’adam’, metrics=[‘accuracy’])

The factors that make up the results. After that, the variables are put back together in a way that works with LSTM. We set up an LSTM model in Keras by making one LSTM layer and one Dense layer with the Sequential API. The LSTM model is what this is. The model was built with the Adam optimizer and a loss function based on the mean squared error (MSE). After setting up the training input and output variables, the number of epochs, the batch size, and the level of verbosity, the fit() function of the Sequential class is used to train the model. After that, the model is used to make predictions about the testing set. 
The mean squared error and the variance of the testing set are used to figure out how accurate the model is. On the control panel, you will be able to see the precision right away. Since the Keras library takes care of the implementation in the background, the LSTM formulas don't need to be implemented directly. This is the case because. The LSTM layer of the model is in charge of the actual process of solving the LSTM equations.

Step 3: Train the CNN-LSTM model on the cleaned and prepared data by using the right loss functions and optimization methods. This will let you get the model ready..

Step 4: Situate the model to the test by determining how accurate it is with data that was not included during the training phase of the project. It is possible to analyze the F1-score, as well as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Step 5: After the model has been trained and checked, you can use the data from the sensors to make a guess about the cow's health. 
Because the technology can make predictions in real time, it gives farmers, and other professionals in the animal health industry an advantage when it comes to fixing problems.
In order to make a good guess about the cow's health, the input data must show temporal patterns. A CNN-LSTM model can help with this. The model can be trained on large data sets to improve its performance, and it can then be linked to a real-time monitoring system to send out alarms at the right time. This improves the cows' health and productivity.

Technologies Used 
In Li et al. (2019) [1], researchers pushed for cutting-edge technologies like the Internet of Things and big data to be used to keep an eye on the health of cattle and, if necessary, send out health alerts.
 The sensors in the system collect information about how the cattle act, where they are, and other things. Then, machine learning algorithms look at this information and make predictions about the health of the cattle. 
The authors said that when their method was used to predict the health of cows, it was accurate more than 90% of the time.
The suggested framework  proposed using LSTM-CNN is based on the idea that cows have an innate intelligence that can be learned
The LSTM can be used to find temporal dependencies, which can then be used to predict a cow's future health
CNN can use the cow's health data to find relevant characteristics
The ways to do things, like decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. 
The proposed hybrid algorithm achieves higher levels of accuracy ,precision, recall, and F1 score than other machine learning approaches that are currently available.
Data Collection Collecting data related to various parameters such as body temperature, milk yield, and feed intake from IoT devices installed in the cow sheds.

 Activation Function Used :
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Activation Function: The ReLU function allows positive inputs to pass through unchanged, but clips negative inputs to zero. This means the function returns the input directly if it is positive, otherwise, it will return zero. It has become the default activation method for many types of neural networks because a model that uses it is easier to train and often achieves better performance.
Model used :
Sequential Model :
The Sequential model is a type of model used in deep learning, which is essentially a linear stack of layers. It’s called “Sequential” because it allows you to build a model layer by layer in a step-by-step fashion

Limitations: A Sequential model is not appropriate when your model has multiple inputs or multiple outputs, any of your layers has multiple inputs or multiple outputs, you need to do layer sharing, or you want non-linear topology (e.g., a residual connection, a multi-branch model)1.

 

These datasets can be used to train and evaluate models for predicting cow health using a smart framework that integrates big data with CNN and LSTM-based IoT approaches. The comparative table reference can help researchers choose the most appropriate dataset for their specific use case.

Alert System
An alert system can be developed using the extracted features and analysis results to predict the health of cows. 
Once the data is collected, it can be pre-processed to extract relevant features and analyzed using machine learning techniques such as deep learning algorithms. The features can include the cow's activity levels, feeding patterns, temperature, heart rate, and other vital signs.
Use Case of Alert System  If the analysis results indicate that the cow's activity levels have decreased, the system can generate an alert, indicating that the cow may be unwell. 
The alert can be sent to the farmer or the animal health expert via a mobile app or an SMS message.
The alert system can also be integrated with other farm management systems, such as feeding and milking systems, to provide a comprehensive overview of the cow'shealth status

The proposed method, which utilizes big data and the Internet of Things to anticipate the health of cows by combining CNN and LSTM, achieves an accuracy of over 95%.
